# Linktree Clone

A simple, free, and open-source Linktree clone where anyone can claim their handle and create their Linktree without requiring login. This project prioritizes simplicity and ease of use, allowing users to quickly create and share their personalized link pages.

## Features

- **No Login Required**: Anyone can claim a handle and create their Linktree instantly.
- **Custom Handles**: Create a unique handle for your profile (e.g., `localhost:3000/your-handle`).
- **Instant Setup**: Add and share your links without any complicated setup.

## How It Works

1. Visit the website and enter your desired handle.
2. Add your links and submit.
3. Share your unique Linktree URL.

> Note: Since there is no login, **links cannot be edited once submitted**. If you need to make changes, you can claim a new handle and recreate your Linktree.

## Environment Variables

The project requires the following environment variables to run:

- `MONGODB_URI`: The connection string for your MongoDB database.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST`: The public URL of your hosted application (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user handles and links.
